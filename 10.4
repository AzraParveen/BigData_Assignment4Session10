1.Write a pig script find the average age of male and female persons died in the titanic tragedy.

we will use the following pig commands:

A = LOAD '/home/acadgild/TitanicData.txt' USING PigStorage (',')
AS (passengerId:int, survived:int, pclass:int, name:chararray, sex=chararray, age:int, sibSp:int, parch:int, ticket:chararray, fare:chararray,cabin:chararray,embarked:chararray);
B = FILTER A by survived==1;      // we are checking for person who died so survived should be 1
C = GROUP B by sex;
D = FOREACH C generate group, AVG(B.age); //using AVG for average
DUMP D;


2.Write a pig script to find the number of people died and survived in each class

we will use the following pig commands:

A = LOAD '/home/acadgild/TitanicData.txt' USING PigStorage (',')
AS (passengerId:int, survived:int, pclass:int, name:chararray, sex=chararray, age:int, sibSp:int, parch:int, ticket:chararray, fare:chararray,cabin:chararray,embarked:chararray);
B = GROUP A by (pclass,survived);
C = FOREACH B generate group, COUNT(A.passengerId); //using count function so as to count total number
DUMP C;
